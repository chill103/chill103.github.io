            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>Preemie children in the NICU have a very difficult time with regulating their internal temperature. One of the goals of the incubators used to help them is to
                help provide them with stable warmth and a suitable, clean evironment for them to continue to grow for several months while doctors and nurses work to ensure they
                are growing properly with minimal complications until they can leave the NICU and go home with their families. Part of the difficulties with preemie babies is not only
                temperature regulation but the fact that they should still be in uttero means that they need stimulations that are found inside the womb but that are not as easily replicated
                in the incurbators. 
            </p>
            <p> One way to help them regulate temperature and provide ways to simulate aspects of the womb that the incubators cannot, is with homemade crafting projects
                that can be given to a family with a preemie in the NICU or donated directly to NICUs (preferred for sanitization reasons). These "craft" projects can be sewing, crochet, knitting,
                etc. that can easily be completed at home without a large financial dedication. This sight will endever to provide a gallery of these projects for users to choose from 
                along with providing them with the best information about materials that can be used with preemies. While the materials used for all babies needs to be carefully chosen
                preemies are espceially sensitive to materials and fabrics. Each project will have its own page with the materials needed and the instructions needed for the project along with
                the information about where/whom the project is from.

                Audience/Users of page (customer, admin, etc.)
                What will be content of the page? 
                Is this a page where you are asking users to enter data on the page?
                Will those data fields need any validations (if any)? 
                Will the page contain buttons or hyperlinks or drop downs?
