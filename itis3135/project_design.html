            <h2>Project Design</h2>

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>Preemie children in the NICU have a very difficult time with regulating their internal temperature. One of the goals of the incubators used to help them is to
                help provide them with stable warmth and a suitable, clean evironment for them to continue to grow for several months while doctors and nurses work to ensure they
                are growing properly with minimal complications until they can leave the NICU and go home with their families. Part of the difficulties with preemie babies is not only
                temperature regulation but the fact that they should still be in uttero means that they need stimulations that are found inside the womb but that are not as easily replicated
                in the incurbators. 
            </p>
            <p> One way to help them regulate temperature and provide ways to simulate aspects of the womb that the incubators cannot, is with homemade crafting projects
                that can be given to a family with a preemie in the NICU or donated directly to NICUs (preferred for sanitization reasons). These "craft" projects can be sewing, crochet, knitting,
                etc. that can easily be completed at home without a large financial dedication. This sight will endever to provide a gallery of these projects for users to choose from 
                along with providing them with the best information about materials that can be used with preemies. While the materials used for all babies needs to be carefully chosen
                preemies are espceially sensitive to materials and fabrics. Each project will have its own page with the materials needed and the instructions needed for the project along with
                the information about where/whom the project is from.
            </p>

            <h3>Client Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Name: Doris Samples and Coworkers
                Company: Savista Revenue Cycle Management
                Email: lsamples@wakehealth.edu

                Reason Behind Project: The team and other coworkers that Ms. Samples works with used to have a member that would organize their company sponsored charity days, where
                instead of working during that day(s), they would instead perform charity work. This person would organize themes for the days and most of the team and coworkers would
                use the same day so that they could work together. One of the more favored themes was creating things for the Wake Forest Baptist Health Brenner's Children's Hostpital
                NICU. This person would organize the different projects for them to choose from, make sure that all of the information about materials they can use was distributed, and 
                keep track of who was doing what. Unfortinantly, this person has moved on to a new position at a different company and there is no one to organize the charity days any longer.
                This site will be a model of how the projects for preemie infants can be gathered in one place for them to choose from while also presenting them with all of the material 
                information and any guidelines that are specific to either Brenner's NICU or Levine's NICU as an example of how different NICUs have different guidelines to be aware of.

            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                This site will have two pages that will have interactivity. The contact page will have a form that will have the user enter their name and email. Then they will choose what kind of message they are submitting for contact. After that they will fill out the message text area with whatever they want to submit and then click the submit button. 
                Once they have submitted the submission will be validated for missing information. If any is missing then the user will be alerted to fill in the missing area. If there is no missing area then the message will be displayed back to the user.

                The display projects page will use JavaScript to both display and to "filter" the results based on the type of project they want to make and display only those kinds. A feature that would also allow the user to refine projects by skill level may also be advantagious as well. To do this, a pre-coded array of structures for the site would be needed so that the specific projects can be searched for.
                The structure would need to include the name of the project, the image file, a small description of the project, the url of the project, and an array for tags. The tags would be the kind of project it is along with the skill level needed.
