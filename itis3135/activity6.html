 Activity #6 - Name the Polygon: Non-Site HTML File
 Purpose: This file will hold some html code for a basic, non-UNCC site based page.
 I am using this page because I have been laid up since Thursday, September 30, 2021, with muscle spasms through my left shoulder and arm.
 I have had to take some powerful muscle relaxers and have been working on assignments when I have been able to using a laptop
 my usual desktop, which is where all of my files for this course are. The functionality of the assingment does appear to work properly. I will wait for this assignment 
 to be graded before I change it over to match with my branded site and resubmit based on the grader feedback on the functionality.

 I am still working on getting everything to execute without an event handler but I have yet to figure it out. I do plan to reach out to my group this week for help
 on this topic. Until then I have added a button that will execute that part of the code.

 Code of Authentication:
 I, Charlotte Hill, Have not copied and pasted code into these pages. I have not gotten help from any person or from any site. I have gotten help from the book to verify any JavaScript coding structures or statements.
