            <h3>Feeding Hummingbirds</h3>

            <p>Feeding hummingbirds is not only a worthwhile experience, it also helps to ensure the presevervation of several spieces of hummingbird that are going extinct while allowing you to watch this majestic bird come to a location where you can see and enjoy their beauty.</p>        
            
            <p>While commercial hummingbird food is available and contains nutrients for the hummingbirds, our company prefers to make our own hummingbird feed. We do this to ensure that there are no additives of anykind that could be harmful not just to hummingbirds but any bird or animal that happens to drink the feed as well. Because of our dedication to making sure that information about hummingbirds is freely sourced to the public for their consumption, we are now sharing our hummingbird feed recipe below!</p>
            
            <div>

                <h4>Ingrediants</h5>
                <ol id="feed_ingrediants">
                    <li>4 cups Water</li>
                    <li>1 cup White Granulated Sugar*</li>
                </ol>
        
                <h4>Directions</h5>
                <ol id="feed_instructions">
                    <li>Pour the sugar into the water and stir until dissolved. It may take several minutes for all of the sugar crystals to dissolve.</li>
                    <li>That's it! Your done! This mixture will store in the refridgerator for up to a week.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>* - You MUST use plain white granulated sugar. It should only contain sugar. Other sugars like brown sugar, substitutes, honey, etc. have some minerals in them that can be very dangerous to hummingbirds.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Why is this recipe so simple and what makes it better than store bought hummingbird feed?</h4>
            <p>Hummingbirds get most of their protein and other nutrients from bugs, insects, and tree sap. However, because they flap their wings so quickly, they also need a lot of sugar to help keep their energy up. </p>

            <p>Store bought hummingbird feed can be a good option if you do not want to make it yourself. Make sure to look for a formula that is 100% sucrose, preferably without any dye added. We choose to make our own because there have been some studies in recent years that have suggest that the red dye used in most ready-made feed is having a negative effect on the hummingbird population. As lovers of hummingbirds, this concerns us. There is also the fact that there are also concentrates available that can be hard to distinguash from the ready to use type. While this may not cause any harm once, it may have a long-term effect on the hummingbirds. Lastly, it is much more cost effective to make your own!</p>
