                <h3><a href="https://www.sixtysixgrillandtap.com/home">Sixty Six Grill & Taphouse</a></h3>
                <p id="p-eval-a">This is a website for a popular local chain restuarant in Kernersville, North Carolina. It is designed to maxmize the customer expectations of the website. It is a relatively simple site and does not contain any kind of extra "filler" materials. The first page of the site makes it immediantly clear that the site is designed for a restuant.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast:<br>The contrast of colors on this page is easy to denote from one another but are also complementary to each other. This is a pleasing color scheme that does not bother the eyes or make things much more difficult to understand.</li>
                    <li>Repetition:<br>The repetitions of the topic areas for this page are easy to identify for the user. Most areas have a small representation on the header navigation and in the footer. The content of the page makes is easy to be able to order food, look at their menu, or view other content. The main problems that I can see is that the locations of the chain are all listed at the bottom but there are no obvious areas or links to find out addresses at the top of the page where the user would immediantly see.</li>
                    <li>Alignment:<br>The site takes as much advantage to space accross the screen as possible with the site going from the left edge to the right edge with little to no padding or margin space. This does allow for a photo rotation of menu items offered to be as big and predomentally as possible.</li>
                    <li>Proximity:<br>Element proximity is overall quite pleasing for the site. It does not seem to be minimal with things jammed together nor so far apart that there is a distince lack of space. However, the header naviagation area could be a few sizes larger. The size of the font seems disproportionally small when compared to the main page elements and the header area has a large amount of white space when compared to other areas of the website. Increasing the topics in the header navigation would allow them to be more easily read and help to create better flow of the content from header to the main body of the page.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>>
        
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.ollies.us/home.html">Ollie's Bargin Outlet</a></h3>
                <p id="p-eval-b">This website is designed for Ollie's to advertise their current merchandise and to offer information about the company, it's locations, and any other relevant information. It is also used to hold a digital version of their current flyer that features addtional deals or any item that they would like to put a spotlight on.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast:<br>While there are areas of Ollie's main page that have appropriate contrast, they are largely drowned out by the very bright yellow color of the background. While yellow can be an appropriate and well thought background color, the shade used leans to a much brighter, almost highlighter like, yellow. It is very hard to look at the site for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, many of the other content colors are either have a large amount of yellow undertone to their colors and begin to blur into the yellow background slight or they are another bright primary color, predominatnly red, that creates a harsher contrast with the bright yellow. There appears to be an attempt to mitigate this by adding a black border around some of the content areas but this largly appears to fail.</li>
                    <li>Repetition:<br>While the site does have a problem with the colors chosen, for each area of content (such as the flyer, store locator, and the rewards program) there are multiple repetitions of each with the same general design elements, such as the cartoon character, that stay consistent with the same colors. This does make it easier to move around the site from different pages and recognize what content is most likely of higher value.</li>
                    <li>Alignment:<br>Most of the site is center oriented for the content. However, there is a truck element on the right side of the page about 2 inches below the header and navigation area. This element is pulling the eye towards it even if the eye has gotten below the content that is at the same level the truck is at. Given that the truck takes the user to a part of the site that lists information about high level company information that the average user will not need to know, it is a very distracting place to put this element for the average user.</li>
                    <li>Proximity:<br>The positions of the elements is average for any webste and does make it easier to keep the flow between the topic sections consistant and easy to read.</li>
                </ul>
